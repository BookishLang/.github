Bookish is a very simple cross-platform programming language that can be considered as an **OOP language**, however Bookish **does not depend on OOP**. This page is for the documentation, introduction of Bookish.

You are also able to ask for help via discussions, submit any issues you encounter or any requests. This can also be considered the help/issues/feature request page of the **Bookish IDE**.
To do so, head over to our Bookish repository.
